# WirelessRealtimeStart [API 1.0]

Start receiving data real time from an ANT device. Wireless scanning must have been started previously.

**Notes:**

* Wireless scanning must have been started previously.
* Real time streaming data will not arrive if the device isnâ€™t being moved; the data should be considered latched.  If sleep mode is disabled during initialization then continuous data is to be expected.
